## Run

The distributed query processor can be used within a simulation and with Ambrosia.


### using Ambrosia
Running our distributed query processor with Ambrosia requires a full installation and setup of Ambrosia as described in https://github.com/microsoft/AMBROSIA.
More concretely, we recommend running the **hello world** example (https://github.com/microsoft/AMBROSIA/tree/master/Samples/HelloWorld) first before starting DCEP-Ambrosia.

To start the Ambrosia implementation for 20 nodes using the input example `AND3_MS.txt`, run the following command from inside the directory `/bin`:
`nice -n 19 bash ../bin/run_all_linux.sh ../inputexamples/queries_google_cluster/AND3_MS.txt -t Minute -w 30 -d 300 --datasetSpeedup 3 --experimentname AND3_MS --doBenchmarkTo CSV > output.txt`

The last lines of the created file `output.txt` contain the totally generated primitve events and projections, as well as number of events sent.
The directory `out\benchmark\` contains for each node latency and throughput metrics. 

### using Simulation

Likewise, our distributed query processor can be started as a simulation using the follwing command from inside the directory `/bin`:

`nice -n 19 ../bin/DCEP.Simulation ../inputexamples/queries_google_clusterAND3_MS.txt -t Minute -w 30 -d 300 --datasetSpeedup 3 --experimentname AND3_MS --doBenchmarkTo CSV > output.txt`

The last lines of the created file `output.txt` contain the totally generated primitve events and projections, as well as number of events sent.
The directory `out\benchmark\` contains for each node latency and throughput metrics. 

#### Parameters

The most important parameters of our distributed query processor are given in the following table:

Parameter | Meaning
------------ | -------------
-t| Required. The time unit events will be generated at rate (n events / time unit).
 -w | Required. The global time window in which event components must occur to trigger a match. The time unit is specified with -t.
-d |  The execution duration of the simulation. Per default it wil run indefinitely. If set to a value, the number of exchanged events within the time period will be measured and eventually printed to stdout. The time unit is specified with -t.
 --doBenchmarkTo | set to 'CSV' to write performance metrics into the /out/benchmarks directory.
--benchmarkInterval | (Default: 10) The time window of benchmark metrics in seconds. They are continuously written to a file in out/benchmark/.
