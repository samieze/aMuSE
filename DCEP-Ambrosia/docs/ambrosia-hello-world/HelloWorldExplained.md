Your first Ambrosia Application - Hello World
=======================================================================

Ambrosia applications consist of a collection of deployed, virtualized, "fat" objects, called instances, where the logic for these instances is defined by programmer authored Immortals. Specifically, each deployed Ambrosia Immortal is an instance with a public interface, whose methods may be invoked by other instances. Instances are fat in the sense that thay are expected to consume at least one core, which means that they may own many finer grained objects. As we'll see, Ambrosia instances are automatically recoverable, relocatable, time travel debuggable, upgadable, and can be made highly available at deployment time with no code changes.

Server
-----------
In this application, we author a server Immortal, called Server, and 3 Client Immortals, each of which demonstrate different interesting features of the Ambrosia programming model. When we deploy, we will create one Server instance, paired with one of our Client instances. Server simply eats messages through a ReceiveMessage method, which returns the number of messages received by the Server instance so far. First, let's take a look at the code for Server. Here is the public declaration of the interface to Server, called IServer:

```
    public interface IServer
    {
        int ReceiveMessage(string Message);
    }
```
Note that this interface is declared in the IServer project in Hello World. Once this project is compiled, the Ambrosia code generation tool (AmbrosiaCS) may be run to generate all necessary base Immortal code for the Server implementation. In particular, this generated code will contain a base class for Server, as well as proxy classes for making method calls on any Server instance.

Next, let's look at the code for the Server Immortal implementation, found in the Server project:
```
        [DataContract]
        sealed class Server : Immortal<IServerProxy>, IServer
        {
            [DataMember]
            int _messagesReceived = 0;

            public Server()
            {
            }

            public async Task<int> ReceiveMessageAsync(string message)
            {
                Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
                Console.WriteLine("\n!! SERVER Received message from a client: " + message);
                Console.ResetColor();

                _messagesReceived++;
                return _messagesReceived;
            }

            protected override async Task<bool> OnFirstStart()
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
```
First, note the use of IServer, which is in the project generated from the IServer interface project, which specifies the public interfaces that must be implemented by the Immortal. Note that the generated version of IServer uses async methods, which requires an implementation that is async. While this is not important for Server, we will see how this is exploited in Client3.

Also, observe that Server inherits Immortal<IServerProxy>. This base class and template parameter indicate that we are implementing an Immortal, whose self reference proxy is of type IServerProxy. IServerProxy is also in the generated project. While the self reference proxy isn't important for Server, we will see how this can be important for other Immortals (e.g. Client2).

Note the lack of any logging code, reconnection or retry code, or explicit instructions to push or pull state to storage. Nevertheless, instances of Server will never lose data or messages, can be migrated transparently from one machine/vm/pod to another, can be deployed in a highly available fashion through active/active replication, and can be debugged by going back in time and rolling forward, called time travel debugging. There are only two requirements Ambrosia makes of C# programmers:

* Given the same input method calls in the same order, the Immortal must arrive at an equivalent state, and generate the same outgoing instance method calls in the same order.
* The Immortal author must provide a way to serialize Immortal instances, through DataContract, so that deserialization will create an Immortal with equivalent state.

The first requirement is trivially accomplished through Ambrosia's threading and dispatch model. In Ambrosia, all method calls are executed serially, unless an async call is made, as in Client3. Since there are no outgoing method calls in Server, all ReceiveMessageAsync calls are executed one by one to completion, guaranteeing the first requirement.

The second requirement is met by labeling the class as DataContract, and labeling the _messagesReceived member as DataMember. This ensures that _messagesReceived is protected, and in the case of failure, will be reconstituted to the correct value when recovery occurs. Note that not all members must be labled in this way, as they may be computed from other members, or may not be important to serialize (e.g. rendering state).

Also note the existence of the method OnFirstStart, which is an initialization method called once when an instance is created. Like other methods, OnFirstStart is executed serially with respect to other method calls. OnFirstStart returns a bool because of limitations in our abilitiy to serialize tasks in C#. As a result, OnFirstStart, which could make an async call to another instance, must have a return value, although its not used. We will discuss this issue further in our section on Client3.

Note that the Immortal class defined above must be instantiated in a running C# program. For this reason, we've embedded this Immortal in a console program, with the following Main:
```
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int receivePort = 2001;
            int sendPort = 2000;
            string serviceName = "server";

            if (args.Length == 1)
            {
                serviceName = args[0];
            }

            using (var c = AmbrosiaFactory.Deploy<IServer>(serviceName, new Server(), receivePort, sendPort))
            {
                Thread.Sleep(14 * 24 * 3600 * 1000);
            }
        }
```
Each time the Immortal is recovered or relocated, or an active replica created, the above Main will execute. The only really relevant line from Ambrosia's point of view, is the using statement, which stands up the Ambrosia instance inside the process which is running Main. Note the Thread.Sleep, which puts the main thread to sleep for 14 days. This is just a simple convenience to keep the program from exiting early. In practice, something like an AsyncQueue can be used to put the main thread to sleep until the Immortal decides to complete and end. Client1 shows how this can be done. In this sense, Ambrosia can be used for both "jobs" and "services", where jobs logically terminate and services logically run forever.

Note that currently, each process can only have one Immortal, due to global data structures which aren't currenly sharable. This limitation could, however, change eventually.

Another thing to note in main, is the existence of receivePort and sendPort. The two variables are passed into the Deploy method, and are the two ports which this process uses to communicate with its local ImmortalCoordinator. Specifically, each instance consists of two running processes which run in the same VM/machine/container, and which fail and recover together. When logically creating instances with the Ambrosia RegisterInstance command, these ports are specified in reverse, which is to say that the ImmortalCoordinator's receive port is the application process's send port, and visa-versa.

Finally, observe serviceName in the Deploy call, which is the name of this particular Ambrosia instance that is being initialized or recovered. This name is stored in an Azure Table which contains a directory of Ambrosia instances, and the logical connections between instances. Note that a single instance can have many replicas, all with the same service name.

Client1 - The Basics
-----------
Client1 is a simple example of an Amborsia job, in the sense that it is a distributed component which completes. In particular, it sends 3 messages to Server, reading a line from the user after the first message is sent. Reading this line gives us an opportunity to break Client1 and restart it, initiating recovery. Even though the job sends a message and is restarted, only 3 messages will arrive at Server.

In this case, Client1 has no public methods, so the interface is empty:
```
    public interface IClient1
    {
    }
```

Nevertheless, codegen is needed, because each Immortal runs a codegen step which includes its own interface, and all the interfaces of all the other Immortals it will make calls on. In this case, that includes IServer. We are now ready to look at the code for the Client1 Immortal:

```
    [DataContract]
    class Client1 : Immortal<IClient1Proxy>, IClient1
    {
        [DataMember]
        private string _serverName;

        [DataMember]
        private IServerProxy _server;

        public Client1(string serverName)
        {
            _serverName = serverName;
        }

        protected override async Task<bool> OnFirstStart()
        {
            _server = GetProxy<IServerProxy>(_serverName);


            _server.ReceiveMessageFork("\n!! Client: Hello World 1!");

            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine("\n!! Client: Sent message 1.");
            Console.WriteLine("\n!! Client: Press enter to continue (will send 2&3)");
            Console.ResetColor();

            Console.ReadLine();
            _server.ReceiveMessageFork("\n!! Client: Hello World 2!");
            _server.ReceiveMessageFork("\n!! Client: Hello World 3!");

            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine("\n!! Client: Press enter to shutdown.");
            Console.ResetColor();

            Console.ReadLine();
            Program.finishedTokenQ.Enqueue(0);
            return true;
        }
    }
```
In addition to the aspects already familiar from Server, note that our constructor is no longer empty. The construstor is used to pass information from the hosting program to the Immortal instance, prior to initialization or recovery. In this case, that includes the name of the Server instance, called "server" by default. This is passed into the constructor because we will need to establish a connection to server before making method calls on it.

As a consequence, the first line of OnFirstStart makes the connection to the specified Server instance using GetProxy. The return value of this call is an object which contains all public method calls on the specified instance. Note that the member holding the Server proxy is labaled a datamember. As a result, the GetProxy method only needs to be called once in OnFirstStart, since recovery will automatically reconstitute the proxy.

The next line calls server's ReceiveMessageFork method. Note that each Ambrosia call has two forms: the fork form is a form of message passing, where the call is made asynchronously, is not awaitable, and whose return value is ignored. The second form is async, which is awaitable (see Client3). The fork version of the call is by far the most performant and is generally encouraged. The async version has the advantage of being more flexible in its use, but has serious limitations, fundamental to the nature of async calls in recoverable frameworks like Ambrosia. In this case, we do the ReceiveMessageFork call and continue, immediately writing a couple lines and waiting on user input.

This is a good time to break the execution of Client1, Server, or both. If either or both is restarted, they will correctly recover to the state prior to breaking.

After pressing Enter, the program continues, sending two more messages. The last action of OnFirstStart is to enqueue a token into a global AsyncQueue called finishedTokenQ, which upon receipt, will exit the program (see below):

```
        public static AsyncQueue<int> finishedTokenQ;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            finishedTokenQ = new AsyncQueue<int>();

            int receivePort = 1001;
            int sendPort = 1000;
            string clientInstanceName = "client";
            string serverInstanceName = "server";

            if (args.Length >= 1)
            {
                clientInstanceName = args[0];
            }

            if (args.Length == 2)
            {
                serverInstanceName = args[1];
            }

            using (var c = AmbrosiaFactory.Deploy<IClient1>(clientInstanceName, new Client1(serverInstanceName), receivePort, sendPort))
            {
                finishedTokenQ.DequeueAsync().Wait();
            }
        }
```
Also, note that the server instance name, which is "server" by default, is passed into the constructor for Client1 in the Deploy call.

Understanding Recovery for Client1
-----------
Let's assume that Client1 and its associated ImmortalCoordinator were exited (e.g. Ctrl-C) and restarted when user input was requested. Let's go through the recovery actions taken by Ambrosia:

* First, it is important to understand that when an instance is started for the first time, an initial checkpoint is taken which represents the state of the Immortal just prior to the execution of OnFirstStart. Since no additional checkpoint was taken, recovery begins by deserializing the initial state of the Immortal.
* Next, recovery replays all method calls which occurred since the recovered checkpoint was taken. In this case, we execute OnFirstStart from the initial state. During this execution, we again generate the first message to server, and ask for user input. Note that once all methods have been replayed (i.e. the application method invocation has happened), the recovering Immortal reconnects to previously connected Immortals. Part of that reconnection involves determining which method calls have already been received by the various parties, and ensures exactly once method delivery/execution everywhere. In this case, if server received the method call before client was killed, it will not be resent. If, however, the message was never actually received by server, the reconstructed method call is sent.

Client2 - Handling Non-Determinism
-----------
In the Client1 example, the messages sent to server were predetermined and written into the actual Client1 code. What if, instead, we wanted to send a message typed in by the user? This is problematic, because in order for the above recovery strategy to work correctly, it would require a user to retype the same messages during recovery. In fact, Client1 has the following problem: if failure happened after the user pressed Enter, but before it completed, the user would be required to press Enter again after recovery!

In order to handle such situations, Ambrosia has a feature called impulse methods. Impulse methods are specially labelled publically callable methods which capture non-replayable information coming into the system. Typically, outside information, like user input, is passed into Ambrosia as parameters to these method calls. These parameter values are logged by Ambrosia, prior to calling the associated impulse methods, guaranteeing that the data isn't lost. Like other method calls, they are called using instance proxies, and are defined in Immortals like any other method. They differ from other methods in two important ways:

* Only the impulse calls which are logged (which happens prior to calling the method) are guaranteed to survive failure. For instance, if outside information, like user input, is collected by the program, but the program crashes prior to that input being logged, that information will be lost.
* Impulse methods are not allowed to be called during recovery, since recovery must return the system to a replayably deterministic state. As a result, impulse methods are typically called by background threads, which can only be started after recovery is complete (see below).

In this case, Client2 has an impulse method, called ReceiveKeyboardInput, which receives message strings entered by the user, and sends them to server. As a result, Client2 has a non-empty interface IClient2:

```
    public interface IClient2
    {
        [ImpulseHandler]
        void ReceiveKeyboardInput(string message);
    }
```
Note the attribute [ImpulseHandler], which is defined in AmbrosiaLibCS, which specifies that ReceiveKeyboardInput is an impulse method.

Next, let's look at the actual Immortal Client2:

```
    [DataContract]
    class Client2 : Immortal<IClient2Proxy>, IClient2
    {
        [DataMember]
        private string _serverName;

        [DataMember]
        private IServerProxy _server;

        public Client2(string serverName)
        {
            _serverName = serverName;
        }

        void InputLoop()
        {
            while (true)
            {
                Console.Write("Enter a message (hit ENTER to send): ");
                string input = Console.ReadLine();
                thisProxy.ReceiveKeyboardInputFork(input);
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }

        protected override void BecomingPrimary()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Finished initializing state/recovering");
            Thread timerThread = new Thread(InputLoop);
            timerThread.Start();
        }

        public async Task ReceiveKeyboardInputAsync(string input)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sending keyboard input {0}", input);
            _server.ReceiveMessageFork(input);
        }

        protected override async Task<bool> OnFirstStart()
        {
            _server = GetProxy<IServerProxy>(_serverName);
            return true;
        }
    }
```
First, note that our impulse method, ReceiveKeyboardInputAsync, looks like any other public method, and simply calls server's ReceiveMessage. The difference is in how ReceiveKeyboardInputAsync is called. Rather than being called from a replayable method like OnFirstStart, it's called from a background thread that is started from BecomingPrimary.

BecomingPrimary is an overloadable method for performing actions after recovery is complete, but before servicing the first method calls after recovery. By putting our user input requesting loop in the thread created during BecomingPrimary, we ensure that ReceiveKeyboardInputAsync will not be called during recovery.

Despite the non-deterministic user input, Client2 is replayably deterministic, logging all user input in calls to ReceiveKeyboardInput, and readers are encouraged to interrupt and restart the client and server to observe behavior.

Understanding Recovery for Client2
-----------
Let's assume that Client2 and its associated ImmortalCoordinator were exited (e.g. Ctrl-C) and restarted after user input was entered, and the associated impulses called. Let's go through the recovery actions taken by Ambrosia:

If we are starting from the initial checkpoint, OnFirstStart is re-executed, which has no real effect since we had previously made the connection to the server anyway.

The previously logged impulse calls are then executed serially in their original order, resulting in a series of buffered outgoing calls to the server. After all logged calls are executed, recovery is over, and BecomingPrimary is called. At this point, the user may start entering new input, resulting in the buffering of outgoing impulse calls to itself, if reconnection to itself has not yet happened.

Once the instance is reconnected to itself, any buffered impulse calls are sent to itself and, after being logged, executed. These executed impulses may result in further buffered calls to the server if server reconnection has not yet happened.

Note that the server will have received some portion of the buffered calls, in the order in which they are reproduced, but may not have received some of the last buffered calls, including possible new calls made after becoming primary. Upon reconnection, unsent calls from client3 are sent to the server.

Client3 - Async calls (See caveats, limitations, and best practices at the end before running)
-----------
This client demonstrates Ambrosia's ability to make remote method calls in an async manner, just like calling regular async methods in C#. While this can be a very useful feature for some Immortals, there are important limitations associated with async method invocation. Note that these issues are endemic to implementing virtual resiliency in languages like C#. These limitations, their cause, and best practices will be discussed at the end of this section of the guide.

Client3, like Client1, has no externally callable methods. As a result, the interface is empty:

```
    public interface IClient3
    {
    }
```

Client3 makes 2 ReceiveMessageAsync calls, awaiting each one before continuing:

```
    [DataContract]
    class Client3 : Immortal<IClient3Proxy>, IClient3
    {
        [DataMember]
        private string _serverName;

        [DataMember]
        private IServerProxy _server;

        public Client3(string serverName)
        {
            _serverName = serverName;
        }

        protected override async Task<bool> OnFirstStart()
        {
            _server = GetProxy<IServerProxy>(_serverName);
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;

            var t1 = _server.ReceiveMessageAsync("\n!! Client: Hello World 3 Message #1!");
            Console.WriteLine("\n!! Client: Sent message #1.");

            var res1 = await t1;
            Console.WriteLine($"\n!! Client: Message #1 completed. Server acknowledges processing {res1} messages.");

            var t2 = _server.ReceiveMessageAsync("\n!! Client: Hello World 3 Message #2!");
            Console.WriteLine("\n!! Client: Sent message #2.");

            var res2 = await t2;
            Console.WriteLine($"\n!! Client: Message #2 completed. Server acknowledges processing {res2} messages.");

            Console.WriteLine("\n!! Client: Shutting down");
            Console.ResetColor();
            Program.finishedTokenQ.Enqueue(0);
            return true;
        }
    }
```

First, note that the generated IServerProxy automatically contains an async version of ReceiveMessage, which we simply use like any other C# async call. Similarly, we may await the completion of the call just as other async methods in C#. In Ambrosia, there is one dispatch thread which dispatches all Ambrosia method calls. When an async call on another instance is made, as in the call to ReceiveMessageAsync, the dispatch thread becomes free to process any incoming method calls, as well as return values for previously made async calls to other instances. Since there is only one dispatch thread, which is shared for both processing incoming method calls, as well as processing continuations of awaiting method calls, there is no parallel execution, although there is concurrent execution.

Understanding Recovery for Client3
-----------
To better understand the implications of using async calls, we walk through a possible execution and recovery of Client3. Consider the case where Client3 is run after the server is defined, but down. Client3 will successfully connect to the server, since it has been created. When the first ReceiveMessageAsync is called, the call is queued up for delivery once the server comes back up. The first output message is then printed on the screen. Once we hit the first await, execution of OnFirstStart is suspended until the server receives the first method call, executes it, and returns the result. Note that while OnFirstStart is suspended, other Client3 methods, if there were any, could be invoked by other instances. In this case, there are no methods to call, so Client3 will simply wait.

If we killed Client3 at this point and restarted, OnFirstStart would be replayed, and the system would return to the exact same state it was in before Client3 was killed. Note that if a checkpoint were taken while OnFirstStart was suspended, that checkpoint would include a serialized version of the task being awaited. That task and its state would then be recovered as part of recovering Client3.

As soon as the server comes back up, the method call would be sent, and eventually executed. Since the call was made async, the return value would eventually arrive, and OnFirstStart would be woken up and continue. In this manner, Client3 would run until OnFirstStart completed, enqueueing a token in finishedTokenQ, killing Client3.

Caveats, Limitations, and Best Practices for Async method calls
-----------
In order to create checkpoints with suspended methods that made async calls, we serialize the task associated with the method call that makes the async call. This is functionality not officially supported by the C# runtime, and is provided by a library available on Nuget which relies on how the state machine for async programs is created by the C# compiler. Because of this, we have issue #1:

1) All Immortals, and code generated proxies/base classes used by those Immortals MUST BE COMPILED DEBUG. This disables performance optimizations which potentially change how the async state machine is generated.

Also, one of Ambrosia's most useful features is its ability to run logs and patch live instances with new versions of Immortals which don't change the state or remove method calls (see [TimeTravel-Windows.md](./TimeTravel-Windows.md)). Since code modifications can affect the state machine for async, we have issue #2:

2) There is no guarantee that code patches which don't disrupt Immortal APIs and state can recover checkpoints produced by instances making async calls.

Finally, Ambrosia has a very useful live instance upgrade capability which allows code upgrades, even if state and APIs change. Because suspended tasks have associated call stacks which may no longer even correspond to possible stacks in new code versions:

3) There is no guarantee that live instance upgrades will work on instances making async calls.

Note that issues 2 and 3 are quite fundamental to languages using C#s style of async, and will likely not be improved over time. Issue #1, however, is addressable, although it is not in scope at this time for the Ambrosia project.

In summary, the above limitations and caveats lead us to the following best practice for using async calls:

 * Async calls are reasonable to make within jobs, but not services, unless service updates/upgrades are always started from an initial state, rather than a recovered state.

This best practice comes from the assumption that you will not try to suspend, repair, and continue a job, but rather, will restart it. On the other hand, services must be able to evolve over time. Of course, if service modifications are not rolled out using Ambrosia recovery, but rather, are always started from an initial state, and take over after the old code is retired, async calls are fine.
