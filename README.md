#  MuSE Graphs for Flexible Distribution of Event Stream Processing in Networks
## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of aMuSE/aMuSE*, oOP and DCEP-Ambrosia - a light-weight implementation for distributed complex event processing using Microsoft Ambrosia.

#### aMuSE

The directory `aMuSE` contains the implementation of aMuSE/aMuSE* as well as the scripts used to conduct the experiments presented in the paper.

#### oOP

The directory `oOP` contains the implementation of the optimal operator placement for a given network and query.

#### DCEP-Ambrosia

The directory `DCEP-Ambrosia` contains the implementation of distributed complex event processing using Microsoft Ambrosia. The query processor can alternatively be started as a simulation instead of Ambrosia.

#### Inputs

The directory `Inputs` contains the network configuration, event rates and query workloads used in the experiments.
