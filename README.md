## Supplementary Material

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of aMuSE/aMuSE*, oOP and DCEP-Ambrosia - a light-weight implementation for distributed complex event processing using Microsoft Ambrosia.

#### aMuSE

The directory `aMuSE` contains the implementation of aMuSE/aMuSE* and the scripts used to conduct the experiments presented in the paper.

#### oOP

The directory `oOP` contains the implementation for an optimal operator placement given a network and a query.

#### DCEP-Ambrosia

The directory `DCEP-Ambrosia` contains the implementation of distributed complex event processing using Microsoft Ambrosia. The query processor can alternatively be started as a simulation which does not require to locally set up Ambrosia.

#### Inputs

The directory `Inputs` contains the network configuration, event rates and query workloads used in the experiments.
